Alameda is an intelligent cloud resources orchestrator for Kubernetes, running on the control path and providing predictive analytics for a better container operation.

Deeply integrated with Kuberbetes, Alameda learns compute and I/O metrics, predict the future demands of pods, and orchestrate underlying resources for autonomous pod balancing, scaling and scheduling by using machine learning.

For more details about Alameda, please refer to the project status section below. You're welcome to use Alameda, and invited to contribute to the community. We plan to continue adding supports based on community demand and engagement in future releases.
